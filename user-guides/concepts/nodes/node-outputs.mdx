On this page you will learn what is a `Node Output` in Trickest platform is and how you should think about node outputs when designing your workflows.

## Command Line Tools Outputs

Let's go back to our example tool execution screenshots

In this example, we are running `nikto` tool with `-h` parameter that specifies the target URL. Usually, security engineers are also passing the `-o` parameter to specify the output file.

This file is saved locally for a later consumption and analysis. 

## Trickest Node Outputs

In Trickest, the output of the tool execution is saved in the `node` output. We haven't still tackled how tool execution works, but for now, think about node output as a file that is generated by a specific node by passing it `-o` parameter.

Each node has a default output folder. This folder is used to store the output of the tool execution.

Output folder is created for each node while installing the tool and it is in `out` directory.

`File` and `Folder` outputs are default outputs for each node type of ([Tool](node-types/tool) or [Script](node-types/script)).

## File Output 

File output is a file that is generated by a node. It can be used to provide a file content to another node or download it to your local machine.

<Warning>The `output.txt` is a default path for file output. This path will be used for next [Node Connections](node-connections) file inputs.</Warning>

## Folder Output

In some cases, the tool execution generates multiple files. In this case, you can use the `Folder` output to provide multiple files to another node.


This is all you need to know for now, in next section we are going to cover [Node Connections](node-connections) and how you can connect nodes to each other.
