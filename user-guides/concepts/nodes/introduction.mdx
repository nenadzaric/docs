On this page you will learn what is a `node` in Trickest platform and how it serves as a main building block for executing offensive cybersecurity workflows.

## Trickest Node

Trickest Node is a [containerized environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)) that wraps a specific tool or script and provides a standardized way of executing it.

This way, Trickest solves 2 out of 4 challenges we mentioned previously

    * ✅ **Download the tool** - You don't need to download the tools anymore, it will be available in the platform or can be imported.
    * ✅ **Install dependencies** - The dependencies needed and optimal operating system for the tool are preinstalled, you don't need to worry about this ever again.
    * Configure the tool
    * Run the tool

## Tool Configuration & Inputs

If you remember from previous page, the tool execution and configuration comes with it's own parameters

```
bash 

sample-tool -d http://trickest.com

```

In this example, we are running `nikto` tool with `-h` parameter that specifies the target URL.

In Trickest, you can configure the tool execution and parameters in the `node` configuration. What is more important, you don't need to worry about the command parameter values, they will have a human-readable format easy to understand.

## Inputs

Parameter values are explicitly provided through a different node called `inputs`

Inputs can be 

* **String** 
* **File**
* **Folder**
* **Boolean**

Let's look at example of String input.

<Tip>In Trickest Editor, command for tool execution will be automatically generated.</Tip>

Now, let's look how different inputs can be used in Trickest.
