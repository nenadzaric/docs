On this page you will learn what is a `Node Input` in Trickest platform is and how you can configure tools in `Trickest Editor`. 

<Info>This page only cover configuring single [Nodes](introduction) and not [**Node** to **Node** connections](node-connections). For more information on how to connect nodes, please refer to the [Node Connections](node-connections) page.</Info>

## Node Input

A `Node Input` is a specific value that is provided to a [Node](introduction) in Trickest platform. It can be a string, file, folder or boolean value.

## Required Node Inputs

Some of the inputs are required for the tool to run successfully. For example, a tool might require a target URL to scan or a file containing a list of subdomains to brute force. These parameters will be enabled by default when you drag & drop a node in `Trickest Editor`.

## Types of Node Inputs

### String

String input is a simple text value that can be provided to a node. It can be used to provide a target URL, a file path or any other text value.

#### String Input Examples

Some of the examples of the real world for String input values:

* `threads` - Number of threads to use in a tool, e.g. `10`
* `target` - Target URL to scan, e.g. `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`
* `output-type` - Type of output to generate, e.g. `json`
* `user-agent` - User agent to use in HTTP requests, e.g. `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

In this example, you can see `trickest.com` and `100` being connected to the `node` as `String` inputs.

<Tip>String inputs are colored <span style={{color:'purple'}}>purple</span> in the `Trickest Editor.`</Tip>

The Command for the tool execution will be automatically generated based on the input values. In this particular challenges
```bash

subfinder -domain trickest.com -t 100 -output out/subfinder-1/output.txt
```

## Boolean

Boolean input is a true or false value that can be provided to a node. It can be used to enable or disable a specific feature in a tool.

#### Boolean Input Examples

Some of the examples of the real world for Boolean input values:

* `recursive` - Enable recursive subdomain enumeration
* `bruteforce` - Enable subdomain bruteforce
* `verbose` - Enable verbose output
* `json` - Enable JSON output

</Frame>


In this example, you can see `true` being connected to the `json` parameter as `Boolean` input. Finally, the command will be generated as follows:

```bash
subfinder -domain trickest.com -t 100 -json -output out/subfinder-1/output.txt
```

<Tip>Boolean inputs are colored <span style={{color:'blue'}}>blue</span> in the `Trickest Editor.`</Tip>

## File

File input is a file that can be provided to a node. It can be used to provide a file containing a list of targets, a configuration file or any other file.

#### File Input Examples

Some of the examples of the real world for File input values:

* `wordlist` - File containing a list of subdomains to brute force
* `config` - Configuration file for the tool
* `input-file` - File containing a list of targets to scan

Now, let's see how we can enable a Node Input parameter which is not required or enabled by default.

</Frame>

`list` file input has been appeared on the (Node)[/nodes] and we can delete the string input and connect the file input to the `list` parameter.

<Tip>File inputs are colored <span style={{color:'orange'}}>orange</span> in the `Trickest Editor.`</Tip>

### Types of File Inputs

#### External URL

External URL input is a URL that can be provided. It can be used to provide a URL containing file content to be used as an file input to the tool.

Example

```bash
https://s3.amazonaws.com/trickest-public/wordlists/subdomains.txt
```

#### Private File from File Storage

Additionally, you can upload a file to the Trickest platform and use it as a file input.

</Frame>

## Folder

Folder input is a folder that can be provided to a node. 

<Warning>Currently folder inputs only support public git repositories. Private repositories are not supported yet.</Warning>

#### Folder Input Examples

Some of the examples of the real world for Folder input values:

* `templates` - Folder containing templates for the tool
* `screenshots` - Folder to pass screenshots

</Frame>

<Tip> Folder inputs are colored <span style={{color:'yellow'}}>yellow</span> in the `Trickest Editor.` </Tip>

This looks complex right? As we finished the Node Inputs, it is time to move and explain what are [Node Outputs](node-outputs) & [Node Connections](node-connections).
