On this page you will learn how to organize your workflows in Trickest platform using `spaces` and `projects`.

### Workflow Management

#### Copying Workflows

We can also copy workflows between projects and spaces. Let's create a copy of the workflow we've created in the `My New Project` project.

#### Moving Workflows (Sidebar)

You can also move workflows between projects and spaces by dragging and dropping them in the left sidebar.
