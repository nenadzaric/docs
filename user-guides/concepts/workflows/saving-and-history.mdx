On this page you will learn how to save your workflows and how to access the history of explicitly saved workflow versions.

## Saving Workflows

When you are working on a workflow, you can save it by clicking the `Save` button in the middle of the editor. This will save the current state of the workflow.

<Tip>If the `Save` button is not available, it means that current workflow version has not been updated and there is no need to save it.</Tip>


Let's see an example of workflow update and saving:

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Blank Workflow">
    Let's open a blank workflow.
    <Tip>Check out [Creating Workflows in Space](http://localhost:3000/user-guides/concepts/spaces/introduction#creating-a-workflow-in-space) for blank workflow creation</Tip>

  <Step title="Adding subfinder node">
    Let's add `subfinder` and connect `trickest.com` to domain parameter and click `Save`.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Moving the Node and Saving">
    Now, let's move `subfinder` node to the right. You will see that `Save` button became available and we can save the workflow again.
