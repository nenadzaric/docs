In Trickest Platform connecting different [Node Types](../nodes/node-types) through [Node Connections](../nodes/node-connections) creates a workflow. Workflows are the core of the platform and are used to automate and orchestrate different offensive security tasks.

## Workflow Editor

The workflow editor is a place where you develop and customize workflows. It is a provides a way to construct your workflow through various nodes that can be dragged, dropped, connected, and modified.

<Tip>To learn how to create your first empty workflow, check out [Tutorials -> Create Workflow](../../tutorials/creating-workflows)</Tip>

## Builder Mode 

When you create your first workflow, you will be in the builder mode. In this mode, you can add, remove, and connect nodes to create your workflow.

### Left Sidebar

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '2' }}>
  <Frame>
    <img src="images/left-sidebar-drag.gif" alt="Workflow Editor Left Sidebar" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} />
  </Frame>
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: '1', paddingLeft: '20px' }}>   
    The left sidebar contains all the nodes that you can use in your workflow. 
    If you want to use particular tool, you need to drag & drop it's [node](../nodes/node) from left sidebar to the workflow editor like shown in the picture.

    The nodes are divided by:

    * [**Node Types**](../nodes/node-types) - Contains all the different node types that you can use in your workflow.
    * [**Categories**](../library/introduction) - Contains all the nodes that are grouped by their main functionality.

<Tip>Use the **Search...** to find the node.</Tip>

### Right Sidebar

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '1', paddingRight: '20px' }}>
    The right sidebar contains the configuration of the selected node. 
    When you select a node, you can see the configuration options in the right sidebar.

    <Info> If you didn't select any node, the right sidebar will present your workflow details.</Info>

    This sidebar will contain all Command Line input parameters in human readable format available. There, you can **toggle** parameters of particular node to make them visible.

Now that we have covered the basics of the workflow editor, let's move on to [configure our first tool](tools) and get it ready for execution.
