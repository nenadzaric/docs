Tools are the most common node type in the workflow editor. They are used to execute specific processes and tasks. Tools are the building blocks of a workflow and are used to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple to complex.

Tools are used to execute specific processes and tasks, in this section we will cover how to configure a single tool and how commands of the tools are generated.

## First Tool Configuration (`ffuf`)


### Enable Parameters

Let's start by adding a new tool to the workflow. We will use `ffuf` tool to perform a directory brute force attack on a target URL.

</Frame>

Now, let's configure the `ffuf` tool. We want to add `timeout` parameter to be used as additional input parameter besides required inputs. By using `click` you will be presented with the configuration of the tool in the right sidebar.

</Frame>

Now we have all needed input parameters for `ffuf` to be configured. 

* `url` - Target URL on which we will execute directory brute force
* `wordlist` - Wordlist that will be used for directory brute force
* `timeout` - Additional parameter to set HTTP request timeout

### Adding Inputs

There are three main ways to add inputs to the tools:

1. **Drag & Drop Inputs** - Drag and drop the input from the left sidebar and connect it to the tool
2 **Click & Connect** - Click on the parameter and create explicit input
3. **Connect from other nodes t** - Connect the output of another node to the input of the tool

Since we have just one tool we are going to cover first two ways.

#### Drag & Drop Inputs

On the left sidebar, along with the [Library](../../../library/introduction.mdx) of the tools, you can find the **Inputs** section. Here you can find all available inputs that can be used in the workflow.

### Click & Connect

Other way to add inputs to the tool is to click on the parameter and create explicit input. This way you don't need to think about the [Node Inputs and their types](../../../concepts/Nodes/node-inputs.mdx), and then create connection. Connection will be automatically created.

</Frame>


### Adding Values to Input Parameters

For each input we created we need to provide value to be used by the tool. In this case `ffuf`.

* `url` will have value of `https://trickest.com/FUZZ` as string input
* `wordlist` will have value of `common.txt` as file input
* `timeout` will have value of `10` as number input

<Tip>`FUZZ` in this context is `ffuf`'s way of providing place holder for brute force attack.</Tip>


#### Adding Timeout Values

By clicking on the connected node, right sidebar will present different types of inputs and configuration we can do for each [Node Input Type](../../../concepts/Nodes/node-inputs.mdx).

#### Adding URL Values

Now, lets add our URL `https://trickest.com/FUZZ` as a string input to the `url` parameter.

</Frame>


#### Adding Wordlist Values

For wordlist, we will use raw common.txt URL available from GitHub.

<Warning>Do not mistake string values with file values, in the previous example we've added `string` as input for `ffuf`, it just happened that `ffuf` needs URL to work properly. For wordlist, we are adding a URL from which the file can be downloaded</Warning>

## Command Generation

After we've configured all needed inputs for the `ffuf` tool the command that will be automatically generated.

Now, let's move to the next section, how to use [Scripts](scripts) to parse `ffuf` output and extract information.
