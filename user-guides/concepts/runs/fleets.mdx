On this page you will learn what are Trickest Fleets and how they are being utilized when you are executing workflows.

## Trickest Fleets


Trickest Fleet is a group of machines that are used to execute workflows. There are two types of fleets:

- **Managed Fleet** - Fleet of machines that are managed by Trickest. You can use them to execute workflows without any additional configurations.
- **Self-Hosted Fleet** - Fleet of machines that are attached to your account. You can use them to execute workflows on your own machines. These can be any device on any operating system.

Trickest Fleet Page is located in the `Settings` menu. It provides an overview of all available machines and their status. You can see the list of all machines, their type, status, and the list of running workflows on each machine.

<Warning>Depending on your account type, you might have different number of [Self-Hosted](machines#self-hosted-machines) and [Managed](machines#managed-machines) machines.</Warning>

## Machines Management

During the workflow execution, Trickest Execution Engine will automatically assign the machines to the workflow. Additionally, you will be able to choose `Fleet` you want workflow to be executed on.

<Tip>Check out Tutorial for [Attaching a Self-Hosted Machines](../../../tutorials/using-self-hosted-machines)</Tip>


### One Managed Machine Execution Example

Let's execute workflow which is using `python-script` and printing out `Hello World!` message.

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

After you execute the workflow, if you open the [Fleet page](https://trickest.io/dashboard/settings/fleet), you will see that the workflow is executed on the `Managed fleet` and you can follow it's execution.

## Self-Hosted Machines Execution Example

If you have a Self-Hosted machine attached to your account, during the execution you can choose `Self-Hosted Fleet` and execute the workflow on your machine.

<Tip>Self-Hosted Machines can be attached to any device and don't require any custom network configurations.</Tip>

### Prerequisites

In order tu utilize self-hosted machines, you need to have at least one machines attached to Self-Hosted Fleet.

If you succesfully attached self-hosted machine, Self-Hosted fleet will appear in the dropdown menu during the workflow execution.

The same as the managed machine, you can follow the execution of the workflow on the [Fleet page](https://trickest.io/dashboard/settings/fleet).
