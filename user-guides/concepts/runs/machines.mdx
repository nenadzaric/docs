On this page you will learn what are Trickest Machines and how they are being used to execute Trickest Workflows.

## Trickest Machines

Machines represent cloud resources required for executing workflows.

Trickest provides a fixed number of virtual machines to each user, available to be used in workflow executions. Number of machines is predefined by user's [subscription package](https://trickest.com/pricing).

## Managed Machines

Trickest provides several types of machines based on the account. Different machine types have different allocations of CPU and memory, so are suited for workloads with different computational requirements.

Here are the available machine types per user type:

| Machine Type | CPU | RAM |
|--------------|-----|-----|
| Community    | 2   | 4GB |
| Enterprise   | 2   | 8GB |

<Info>For enterprise users, there is a possibility to request more powerful machine specification. Please [contact us](https://trickest.com/talk-with-us/) for more information.</Info>

### Managed Machines States


* *Down* - Machine is not dedicated to any workflow execution. It is on the rest and it is available to be dedicated to some run.
* *Up* - Machine is activated (from Down to Up activation) and it is ready to execute the workflow.
* *Running* - Machine is executing the workflow. It isn't available for any other workflow execution.
* *Error* - Error occurred. It isn't able to do any computation at the moment.


## Self-Hosted Machines

Self-hosted machines are machines that are managed by the user. Users are able to attach their own devices to Trickest Platform to be used in execution.

## Distribution

By using Trickest Execution Engine with combination of [Splitter](../workflows/splitter) nodes, you can distribute the execution of your workflow across multiple machines.

<Tip> Distribution is throughly explained in the [Distributed Execution Tutorial.](../../../tutorials/distributed-execution)</Tip>
