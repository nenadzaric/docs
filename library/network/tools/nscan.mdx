title: "nscan"
description: "Nscan is a fast Network scanner optimized for internet-wide scanning purposes and inspired by Masscan and Zmap. It has it's own tiny TCP/IP stack and uses Raw sockets to send TCP SYN probes. It doesn't need to set SYN Cookies so it doesn't wastes time checking if a received packet is a result of it's own scan, that makes Nscan faster than other similar scanners."
