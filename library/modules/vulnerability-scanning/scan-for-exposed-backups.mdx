## Features
# Scan for Exposed Backups

## Description
Scan for exposed backup files that may leak sensitive information, including source code, database backups, and application logs.

## Features
- Generates **custom wordlists** dynamically based on the hostname.
- Runs heuristic analysis on brute force results to **minimize false positives**.
- Can scan **thousands of web servers** simultaneously.

## Inputs
### Required
- **urls:** a list of URLs
```
https://foo.example.com
https://bar.example.com
```

### Optional
- **header**: Header(s) to include in HTTP requests
- **rate-limit**: Maximum number of requests to send per second per machine (default: 300)

### Outputs
- **findings:** JSONLines records of finding details.
```json

{"finding": "Exposed Backup File", "location": "https://bar.example.com/www.sql.tar.gz", "severity": "unknown", "hostname": "bar.example.com", "domain_name": "example.com", "method": "GET", "description": "A backup file with a size of 567.8MB was detected, which may expose source code, configuration files, or other sensitive information"}
```

## Changelog
