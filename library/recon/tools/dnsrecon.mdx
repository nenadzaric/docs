description: "Author description - DNSRecon is a Python port of a Ruby script that I wrote to learn the language and about DNS in early 2007. This time I wanted to learn about Python and extend the functionality of the original tool and in the process re-learn how DNS works and how could it be used in the process of a security assessment and network troubleshooting. This tool provides the ability to perform: Check all NS Records for Zone Transfers; Enumerate General DNS Records for a given Domain (MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF and TXT); Perform common SRV Record Enumeration; Top Level Domain (TLD) Expansion; Check for Wildcard Resolution; Brute Force subdomain and host A and AAAA records given a domain and a wordlist; Perform a PTR Record lookup for a given IP Range or CIDR; Check a DNS Server Cached records for A, AAAA and CNAME Records provided a list of host records in a text file to check."
