title: "aiodnsbrute"
description: "A Python 3.5+ tool that uses asyncio to brute force domain names asynchronously. It's fast. Benchmarks on small VPS hosts put around 100k DNS resolutions at 1.5-2mins. An amazon M3 box was used to make 1 mil requests in just over 3 minutes. Your mileage may vary. It's probably best to avoid using Google's resolvers if you're purely interested in speed. Trickest currently supports only json output for aiodnsbrute."
