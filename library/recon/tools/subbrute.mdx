description: "SubBrute is a community driven project with the goal of creating the fastest, and most accurate subdomain enumeration tool. Some of the magic behind SubBrute is that it uses open resolvers as a kind of proxy to circumvent DNS rate-limiting (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A). This design also provides a layer of anonymity, as SubBrute does not send traffic directly to the target's name servers."
