## Pre-requisites

To better understand what nodes are, refer to the [Nodes](../../user-guides/concepts/nodes/introduction) and [Workflows](../../user-guides/concepts/workflows/introduction)

## Opening a Blank Workflow

Let's start by opening a blank workflow in the Workflow Editor. On the left side of the editor you will see Library with all of the nodes you can drag and drop into the editor.


## Adding Tools 

In the left sidebar, you will see a `Tools` accordion. If you expand the accordion, you will see a list of categories of the tools available in the editor.

Let's add a tool from `Discovery` category.

## Adding Scripts

In the left sidebar, you will see a `Scripts` accordion. If you expand the accordion, you will see a list of scripts available in the editor.

Let's add a `custom-script` which is a `bash` enabled script used to build the scripts from scratch.

## Adding Modules

<Warning>Modules are part of the [Enterprise Edition](https://trickest.com/pricing). If you are using the Community Edition, you will not see the `Modules` accordion in the left sidebar.</Warning>

In the left sidebar, you will see a `Modules` accordion. If you expand the accordion, you will see a list of modules available in the editor.

Let's add `Scan for Open Ports` module by using the search function.

## Adding Splitter

Splitter is a unique node allowing data to be splitted in different chunks. To learn more about the splitter, refer to the [Splitter](../../user-guides/concepts/nodes/splitter) and [Distribution.](../runs/distribution)

Splitter needs to be connected to [File Input](../../user-guides/concepts/nodes/node-inputs#file) in order to split the lines in a file input in strings.
