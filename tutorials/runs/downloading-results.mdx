Workflow is set of in interconnected [Nodes.](../../user-guides/concepts/nodes/introduction)

Each node executes individually within a [Run](../../user-guides/concepts/runs/introduction) and produces its own result. Hence, there is no single workflow result. Workflow Result is contained of independent nodes results.

## Downloading a Result

<Tip>Use Workflow Runs to go through all of your Runs and open a particular run.</Tip>

When you open a run, you can see the results of each node in the OUTPUT tab. You can view the result by clicking particular nodes and download it by clicking on the `Download` button.

<Tip> You can **scroll** through the result content in the OUTPUT tab. </Tip>

## Splitter Nodes Result

In case of using a Splitter node, for each iteration of affected tool single result is generated and is available to be viewed and downloaded.

## Aggregating Splitter Outputs

If you don't want to click on each of the iteration of the Splitter Nodes, you can use the `recursively-cat-all` script to aggregate all the results into a single file.

<Tip>Connecing Splitter Nodes with `recursively-cat-all` `folder` input will aggregate all the results into a single file.</Tip>

This is the structure of the outputs comming from Splitter Node in the gif below:

```
in/get-js-1/0/output.txt
in/get-js-1/1/output.txt
in/get-js-1/2/output.txt
in/get-js-1/3/output.txt
```

So, the `recursively-cat-all` script will aggregate all the results into a single file by finding all the files in the `in` directory and concatenating them into a single file.

```bash
find in -type f -exec cat {} + | tee out/output.txt
```
