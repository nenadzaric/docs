## Uploading Files from Workflow Editor

If you have a node which is expecting a file input, you can upload the file directly from the Workflow Editor. The file uploaded from the Workflow Editor will be stored in your File Storage and will be available in your [Files](https://trickest.io/dashboard/files) page.

<Warning>If you upload multiple Files through the Workflow Editor, the last uploaded file will be used as the input for the node.</Warning>

## Uploading Files from Workflows

You can also upload files from the Workflows through scripts.

### Uplading Files through `put-trickest-files` tool

To upload a private file from a workflow, you can use the [put-trickest-files](../library/utilities/put-trickest-files) tool. This tool enables you to upload a file, such as the output of a tool or workflow that you want to store for future use. It maintains the file name during the upload process.

The `put-trickest-files` accepts three types of inputs:

* Input content: Use either `input-file` or `input-folder` depending on how many files you want to upload.
* Token: You can authenticate the node using your Trickest Token
<Tip>You can use variable name for `TRICKEST_TOKEN` to avoid hardcoding the token in the script. Pass your token with `${{vars.TRICKEST_TOKEN}}` as `string` input.</Tip>
