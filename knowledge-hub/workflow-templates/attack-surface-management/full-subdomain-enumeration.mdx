<Tip>Category: **Attack Surface Management**</Tip>

<Note>This workflow can help an organization identify all the subdomains within their domain and prioritize vulnerabilities within their environment, allowing them to focus their efforts on securing the most critical areas first. This workflow uses different passive and active techniques to gather subdomains for a specified list of root domains.</Note>

## Setup

You can set up this workflow by changing the following input values:

* **LIST OF DOMAINS** - Provide a file containing a domains list as a target.
* **SECURITY TRAILS API KEY** - Optionally provide a [SecurityTrails API key](https://securitytrails.com/).

## Build in Steps

Visit our blog for a more thorough explanation of how to build this workflow:

* [Full Subdomain Brute Force Discovery Using Automated Trickest Workflow - Part 2](https://trickest.com/blog/full-subdomain-brute-force-discovery-using-workflow/)

## Execution and Results

After setup, the workflow is ready to be executed. Once the workflow's last node, `all subs` script, is finished, the result can be viewed and downloaded.

The `all subs` script will contain all of the resolved subdomains.

[This workflow](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/workflow/6a52bc2b-9073-454c-b2d4-0aa1afea3e19) is available in the Library; you can copy it and execute it immediately!

## Improve this Workflow

* Add more wordlists.
* Implement a mechanism to merge all of the previous results through [scheduling](https://trickest.com/docs/tutorials/scheduling-a-workflow/) and [get-trickest-output](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/tool/9e98f7f0-d3da-43af-9c75-a5be77630292).
