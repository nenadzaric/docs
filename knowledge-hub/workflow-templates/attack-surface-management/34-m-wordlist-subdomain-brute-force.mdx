title: 34 M Wordlist Subdomain Brute-Force
description: 'This workflow uses a 34 million-word wordlist to brute-force subdomains for a given root domain, revealing associated hostnames and providing deeper insights into your attack surface.'
---

<Tip>Category: **Attack Surface Management**</Tip>

<Note>This workflow can brute-force the root domain used as an input in the search for the associated hostnames. This can give you valuable information about the hostnames and thus give you better insight into your attack surface.</Note>

<Check>Complexity: Basic</Check>

### Tools

* [mksub](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/mksub/)
* [puredns](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/puredns/)

## Setup

You can set up this workflow by changing the following input value:

* **ROOT DOMAIN** - Provide the root domain, e.g., trickest.com, as a target.

</Frame>

## Execution and Results

After setup, the workflow is ready to be executed. Once the workflow's last node, `recursively-cat-all` script, is finished, the result can be viewed and downloaded.

The `recursively-cat-all` script will contain all of the hostnames found.

## Build this Workflow in Steps

### Unzipping Wordlist with [unzip-to-out](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/scripts/unzip-to-out/)

Firstly, download the zip wordlist from [https://localdomain.pw/subdomain-bruteforce-list/all.txt.zip](https://localdomain.pw/subdomain-bruteforce-list/all.txt.zip/) as it contains the most comprehensive and all-around wordlist.

</Frame>

### Getting Wordlist with [cat-all-in](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/script/095e9575-066b-4274-bc23-e9b95a3ef275)

As the output from [unzip-to-out](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/scripts/unzip-to-out/) is a folder with all of the files contained in the zip used as input, we will use `cat-all-in` to [cat](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) all of the files into one file. The output should be inside of `out/output.txt`, which is used by the `file` output port.

</Frame>

### Create Potential Hostnames with [mksub](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/mksub/)

Now that we have the wordlist, we can use [mksub](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/mksub/) to merge the wordlist with our root domain.

Firstly, set the string to the `mksub` `domain` parameter. Then, connect the previously added `cat-all-in` output to the `mksub` `wordlist` parameter.

<Frame caption="Creation of Potential Hostnames with mksub and Root Domains">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db14crach/image/upload/v1705321873/docs/34m-wordlist-subdomain-brute-force/34m-brute-force-mksub.gif" alt="creation of potential hostnames with mksub and root domains in the workflow editor"></img>
</Frame>

With `mksub`, we have all of our potential hostnames consisting of the root domain and potential wordlist, which we unzipped previously. Time to resolve!

### Resolve with puredns

It is time to resolve our potential hostnames. [Puredns](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/puredns/) has two types of modes, and in this case, as we have already created hostnames, we will use the `resolve` mode. Additionally, `puredns` uses two resolver file inputs to resolve all of the hostnames used as input. One of our project's [trickest/resolvers](https://github.com/trickest/resolvers/) is focused on that, so we can use the URL inputs for `puredns`, which will be downloaded and used at execution time.

Firstly, connect the wordlist from `mksub` and enable the `resolve` mode.

</Frame>

Next, add `resolvers` and `resolvers-trusted` URLs from the repository.

</Frame>

Additionally, as we are in `resolve` mode, the `domain` parameter is unnecessary, so we can disable it through the [right sidebar.](https://trickest.com/docs/concepts/trickest-ui/editor-page/workflow-builder/right-sidebar-builder-tab/)

### Get Results with [recursively-cat-all](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/script/f00bd5d5-8b14-49aa-80ac-d70dbff5dcaf)

Finally, we will use the [recursively-cat-all script](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/script/f00bd5d5-8b14-49aa-80ac-d70dbff5dcaf), which will cat all of the files into one recursively.

## Try it Out!

[This workflow](https://trickest.io/dashboard/library/workflow/173a06ea-c247-47e6-83c4-89e86179d267) is available in the Library; you can copy it and execute it immediately!

## Improve this Workflow

* Changing [machine type](https://trickest.com/docs/tutorials/how-do-machines-work/#assigning-the-machine-type-to-a-node/) of tools to speed up the execution.
* Adding more wordlist files and connecting them to the `cat-all-in` script node.
* Enabling the `threads` parameter in `puredns` for faster execution.
