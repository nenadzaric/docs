title: GetDNS
description: 'This workflow helps you identify all available DNS servers for a given ASN, allowing for monitoring and securing against potential attacks.'

<Tip>Category: **Attack Surface Management**</Tip>

<Note>Exposed DNS servers can be used to redirect traffic to malicious websites and perform DNS spoofing attacks. Monitor DNS servers for unusual traffic and secure them with access controls and regular updates to prevent these attacks. This workflow will help you get all of the available DNS servers for your ASN.</Note>

<Check>Complexity: Intermediate</Check>

### Tools

* [masscan](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/masscan/)
* [dnsvalidator](https://trickest.com/docs/knowledge-hub/tools/dnsvalidator/)

## Setup

You can set up this workflow by changing the following input value:

* **INPUT_ASN_HERE** - Provide a company's ASN as a target.

## Execution and Results

After setup, the workflow is ready to be executed. Once the workflow's last node, `dnsvalidator` tool, is finished, the result can be viewed and downloaded.

The `dnsvalidator` tool will contain all of the found DNS Servers for a given ASN.

## Improve this Workflow

* Changing [machine type](https://trickest.com/docs/tutorials/how-do-machines-work/#assigning-the-machine-type-to-a-node) of tools to speed up the execution.
* Cover more ASNs by [using-splitters](https://trickest.com/docs/tutorials/building-a-workflow/using-splitters/).
* Execute vulnerability checks on found DNS Servers.
