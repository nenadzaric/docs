# Important Update to PRO Package Subscribers


<Steps>
  <Step title="24 Nov 2023">
    **What's changing for PRO package users?**

    Effective November 28th, 2023, Trickest is transitioning from the current subscription license model to a new, more flexible package.

    - **Canceling PRO package and Monthly Subscriptions**: Moving away from the monthly subscription model to better accommodate varying non-commercial usage needs.
    - **Introduction of Pre-Paid Run Units (RUs)**:
      - Individual users can purchase Run Units (RU) for use on Trickest managed infrastructure.
      - One universal machine type will replace the three previous types.
      - Run Units will replace Credits.
      - RUs have unlimited validity, offering greater flexibility and control over usage.
      - Each minute a workflow runs on a universal machine consumes 2 RUs from the user‚Äôs available RUs.

    **Important:** The Trickest Community edition is for non-commercial purposes only, but individuals can use it for bug bounty purposes. Updated Terms and Conditions will follow. For commercial use, please contact the sales team.

    **What This Means for Current PRO Subscriptions:**

    - **Credit Refill**: On November 28th, Subscribed PRO accounts will automatically receive their current Monthly Subscription credits as Run Units.
    - **Bonus Credits**: An additional 15,000 free Run Units will be provided as a token of appreciation.

    **Actions Required for the Current Billing Cycle of PRO Subscription Users:**

    - All active runs on November 28th at 12 PM UTC will be stopped.
    - All scheduled runs on November 28th at 12 PM UTC will be removed.

# Trickest New Execution Engine

<Steps>
  <Step title="25 Apr 2023">
    The new execution engine is deployed on 24 Apr 2023. Keep in mind the following:

    - **Run Delete** is temporarily unavailable.
    - Due to migration, all historical runs executed before 24 Apr 2023 at 9 AM UTC will be temporarily unavailable from April 24th until May 8th.
    - Trickest outputs used in workflows (trickest://output/{uuid}) won't work until runs are migrated.
    - **File input path changes**: Input handling now directs inputs to a more accurate path, e.g., `in/http-input-<id>/file-name.txt`.
    - **Trickest CLI Update**: The Trickest CLI and Trickest Action have been updated. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/trickest/trickest-cli/releases/tag/v1.1.9).
    - **get-trickest-files, put-trickest-files, diff-trickest-files** are not working currently in workflows; updates are in progress.
